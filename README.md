# 📌 Client Interview – Explained Simply

## 🔹 What is a Client Interview?

A **client interview** is a meeting (call / video / in-person) where the **client talks directly to you** before hiring you or assigning you to a project.

## 🔹 Why Do Companies Take a Client Interview?

The client wants to check:

- ✅ Can you **communicate clearly**?
- ✅ Do you **understand their requirements**?
- ✅ Are you **technically suitable** for their project?
- ✅ Will you **fit into their team**?

> 💡 The client is basically saying:
